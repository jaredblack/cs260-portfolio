    <h1>Portfolio - Jared Black</h1>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Hey! I'm Jared Black. I'm a sophomore studying computer science at BYU with an emphasis in software engineering.
        I also work as a research assistant in the physics department helping
        to develop Python data analysis software for physicists. My interests
        other than programming include music, I play the trumpet and the guitar.
    </p>
